Now dogs pretend they like to fight;

They often bark, more seldom bite;

But yet a Dog is, on the whole,

What you would call a simple soul.

Of course I'm not including Pekes,

And such fantastic canine freaks.

The usual Dog about the Town

Is much inclined to play the clown

And far from showing too much pride

Is frequently undignified.

He's very easily taken in-

Just chuck him underneath the chin

Or slap his back or shake his paw,

And he will gambol and guffaw.

He's such an easy-going lout,

He'll answer any hail or shout.
